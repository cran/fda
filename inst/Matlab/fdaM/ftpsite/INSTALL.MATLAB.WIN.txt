   Installation Notes for Matlab Functions in Windows Systems

                     Jim Ramsay,  McGill University

To install the Matlab functions and sample analyses in a Windows
98/NT/2000/XP system, using Matlab Version 5 through 6.5, follow these
instructions, which will install:
--  the Matlab functions
--  the sample analyses and the data that are analyzed


A.  Installing the Matlab functions:

1. Create a directory to contain the Matlab functions.  For example, on
my system the directory is

    c:\Matlab\fdaM

2. Put the file "Matlabfunctions.zip" into this directory.

3. Extract the function files, each with extension ".m", from this
.zip file using a utility such as WinZip (available on the Web).  Each
of these function files will contain a function with the same name as
the file, and possibly some supporting functions only used by this
function.  Documentation on the use of the functions is found in the
leading lines of the file.

4.  Within this directory, create a subdirectory with the name "@fd".
That is, on my system, this would have the path

    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@fd

This subdirectory will contain functions that are process objects of the
"fd" class.  Move the file "@fd.zip" into this directory, and extract
the function files as you did in step 3.

5.  Repeat step 4 with subdirectory names
  -- @basis  containing .zip file basis.zip
  -- @bifd   containing .zip file bifd.zip
  -- @fdPar  containing .zip file fdPar.zip
  -- @Lfd    containing .zip file Lfd.zip

Thus, on my system, these five directories have paths

    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@basis
    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@bifd
    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@fd
    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@fdPar
    c:\Matlab\fdaM\@Lfd

and each subdirectory should now contain the unzipped functions
appropriate to that directory.


B.  Installing the examples:

There are currently six sample analyses bundled with the data
that are analyzed:
-- the gait data,                      in file gait.zip
-- the growth data,                    in file growth.zip
-- the handwriting data,               in file handwrit.zip
-- the lip movement data,              in file lip.zip
-- the pinch force data,               in file pinch.zip
-- the monthly and daily weather data, in file weather.zip

You might consider setting up a separate subdirectory for each of these
analyses, perhaps within a directory "examples" in the directory
containing the functions set up above.

For each of these analyses and data, move the .zip file with appropriate
name into the appropriate subdirectory.  Then extract the files in this
file using WinZip or some other utility.

To run a sample analysis, start Matlab.  At the top of each sample
analysis file, with the extension ".m", you will find two "addpath"
commands that attach, respectively, the "functions" directory, and the
directory containing the sample data.  The paths in these commands are
what I use in my system, and you may have to change them to what is
appropriate for your system.  For example, at the top of the "monthly.m"
file, you will find the two commands

      addpath('c:\\Matlab\\fdaM')
      addpath('c:\\Matlab\\fdaM\\examples\\weather')

that add the needed paths on my system.

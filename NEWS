Software and datasets to support 'Functional Data Analysis',
second edition (2006) and 'Applied Functional Data Analysis' 
(2002), both by James O. Ramsay and Bernard W. Silverman 
(Springer).  

Release 1.1.7 provides improved documentation and modifications 
to some data sets.  Major modifications from previous releases: 

MINOR INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS:   

	  1.  The 'daily' data set now has a more descriptive name, 
'CanadianWeather', and some enhancements;  see the help page.  

	  2.  The 'melanoma' data set has been modified to match 
the object of the same name in the 'lattice' package.  Accordingly, 
the 'index' column has been deleted and the column name 'melanoma' 
has been changed to 'incidence'.  


ENHANCEMENTS 

	  1.  New functions 'smooth.basisPar' and 'smooth.fdPar' 
simplify common analysis flows that follow an isolated call to 
'dfPar' with a call to either 'smooth.basis' or 'smooth.fd';  these 
tasks can now be performed in one step rather than two.  

	  2.  A new function 'phaseplanePlot' simplifies the 
process of plotting "Acceleration" vs. "Velocity".  

	  3.  A new function 'axisIntervals' facilitates labeling 
months and quarters on plots.  

	  4.  A 'scripts' subdirectory now includes partial scripts 
to replicate some of the analyses in the books.  

	  5.  There have been numerous enhancements to help pages.

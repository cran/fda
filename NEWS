Release 5.1.1 updates the package to conform to current CRAN requirements.  
Changes are:
1.  function Data2fd has been temporarily removed.  We are considering whether
its contribution to the package is useful given the smoothing function
smooth.basis.
2.  functions fRegress.CV and fRgress.stderr have been changed to
fRegressCV and fRegressStderr to avoid collisons with S3 methods.
These functions are not methods for function fRegress.

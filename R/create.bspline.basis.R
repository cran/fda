#  This function creates a bspline functional data basis.
#  Arguments
#  RANGEVAL...an array of length 2 containing the lower and upper
#             boundaries for the rangeval of argument values,
#             or a positive number, in which case command
#             rangeval <- c(0, rangeval) is executed.
#             the default is c(0,1)
#  NBASIS  ...the number of basis functions.  This argument must be
#             supplied, and must be a positive integer.
#  NORDER  ...order of b-splines (one higher than their degree).  The
#             default of 4 gives cubic splines.
#  BREAKS  ...also called knots, these are a non-decreasing sequence
#             of junction points between piecewise polynomial segments.
#             They must satisfy BREAKS[1] = RANGEVAL[1] and
#             BREAKS[NBREAKS] = RANGEVAL[2], where NBREAKS is the total
#             number of BREAKS.  There must be at least 2 BREAKS.
#  There is a potential for inconsistency among arguments NBASIS, NORDER,
#  and BREAKS since
#             NBASIS = NORDER + LENGTH(BREAKS) - 2
#  An error message is issued if this is the case.  Although previous
#  versions of this function attempted to resolve this inconsistency in
#  various ways, this is now considered to be too risky.
#  DROPIND ...A vector of integers specifiying the basis functions to
#             be dropped, if any.  For example, if it is required that
#             a function be zero at the left boundary, this is achieved
#             by dropping the first basis function, the only one that
#             is nonzero at that point.
#  QUADVALS...A NQUAD by 2 matrix.  The first column contains quadrature
#             points to be used in a fixed point quadrature.  The second
#             contains quadrature weights.  For example, for (Simpson"s
#             rule for (NQUAD = 7, the points are equally spaced and the
#             weights are delta.*[1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1]/3.  DELTA is the
#             spacing between quadrature points.  The default is
#             matrix("numeric",0,0).
#  VALUES ... A list, with entries containing the values of
#             the basis function derivatives starting with 0 and
#             going up to the highest derivative needed.  The values
#             correspond to quadrature points in QUADVALS and it is
#             up to the user to decide whether or not to multiply
#             the derivative values by the square roots of the
#             quadrature weights so as to make numerical integration
#             a simple matrix multiplication.
#             Values are checked against QUADVALS to ensure the correct
#             number of rows, and against NBASIS to ensure the correct
#             number of columns.
#             The default value of is VALUES is vector("list",0).
#             VALUES contains values of basis functions and derivatives at
#             quadrature points weighted by square root of quadrature weights.
#             These values are only generated as required, and only if slot
#             QUADVALS is not matrix("numeric",0,0).
#  BASISVALUES...A vector of lists, allocated by code such as
#             vector("list",1).
#             This field is designed to avoid evaluation of a
#             basis system repeatedly at a set of argument values.
#             Each list within the vector corresponds to a specific set
#             of argument values, and must have at least two components,
#             which may be tagged as you wish.
#             The first component in an element of the list vector contains the
#             argument values.
#             The second component in an element of the list vector
#             contains a matrix of values of the basis functions evaluated
#             at the arguments in the first component.
#             The third and subsequent components, if present, contain
#             matrices of values their derivatives up to a maximum
#             derivative order.
#             Whenever function getbasismatrix is called, it checks
#             the first list in each row to see, first, if the number of
#             argument values corresponds to the size of the first dimension,
#             and if this test succeeds, checks that all of the argument
#             values match.  This takes time, of course, but is much
#             faster than re-evaluation of the basis system.  Even this
#             time can be avoided by direct retrieval of the desired
#             array.
#             For example, you might set up a vector of argument values
#             called "evalargs" along with a matrix of basis function
#             values for these argument values called "basismat".
#             You might want too use tags like "args" and "values",
#             respectively for these.  You would then assign them
#             to BASISVALUES with code such as
#               basisobj$basisvalues <- vector("list",1)
#               basisobj$basisvalues[[1]] <-
#                               list(args=evalargs, values=basismat)
#  BASISFNNAMES ... Either a character vector of length NABASIS
#             or a single character string to which NORDER, "." and
#             1:NBASIS are appended by the command
#                paste(names, norder, ".", 1:nbreaks, sep="").
#             For example, if norder = 4, this defaults to
#                     'bspl4.1', 'bspl4.2', ... .
#  Returns
#  BASISFD ...a functional data basis object

#    norder = 2 = two basis functions = 2 right triangles,
